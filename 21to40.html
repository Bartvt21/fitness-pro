					<h4>Special Tips:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><span>1. Reward yourself with a massage:</span> Cool-downs are your first line of defence against lactic acid build up and muscle soreness, but you don't have to fight the fight on your own. Massage is a great way of helping your metabolism recover from the effort and trauma of your gym sessions. A good massage also helps reinforce the sense of reward.</li>
						<li><span>2. Stay off the scales:</span> Don't assume that the scale is always a true measure of what is going on with the body. If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.</li>
						<li><span>3. Fill the freezer:</span> Frozen prawns are as good as fresh: in fact most of the "fresh" prawns you've bought in your life were actually defrosted before they were sold to you.</li>
						<li><span>4. Put your best foot forward:</span> When looking for a parking bay, try to find one further away from your destination and walk briskly. Walk when talking on your mobile phone. If you need to get a message or documents to a colleague at work, get up and do it yourself rather than sending an SMS, email or messenger.</li>
						<li><span>5. Start drinking pints of water:</span> Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.</li>
						<li><span>6. Play with your pinkies:</span> Try playing imaginary piano scales with your toes. Joseph Pilates was a great believer in body control and this is a great exercise for trying to re-establish the links between brain and body. It's not as easy as you might think.</li>
						<li><span>7. Keep your eye on GI:</span> Eat low GI foods. They result in lower insulin levels which makes fat easier to burn and less likely to be stored. Low GI foods include multigrain bread, rolled oats or muesli, biscuits made with dried fruit and whole grains, apples, citrus fruits, sweet potatoes and sweet corn.</li>

					<li>41. Be careful of snacking. You can easily munch 600 calories of pretzels or chips without realizing it.</li>
					<li>42. Watch your serving size. A serving of pasta is 1 cup, but some people routinely eat 4 cups and think that they are just eating one. </li>
					<li>43. Avoid the super size bagels. Some have a calorie content of 400 to 500 calories per bagel.</li>
					<li>44. Read the Serving Size on the Nutrition Facts panel on most food product.</li>
					<li>45. Nuts are healthy but high with calories. Use nuts as a garnish instead of a snack.</li>
					<li>46. All energy bars and fruit smoothies are not low in calories. Start to read and compare serving sizes and calorie content.</li>
					<li>47. A smoothie made with fat-free milk, frozen fruit, and wheat germ (or protein powder) can be a great meal replacement.</li>
					<li>48. If it’s a fast food burger you crave, order the smallest fast-food burger (with mustard and ketchup, NO mayo) and drink water. You can add an apple or baby carrots to complete your meal.</li>
					<li>49. Go back in time. Remember you lunch time meals when you were a kid? A peanut butter sandwich on whole wheat bread with a glass of 1 percent milk and an apple.</li>
					<li>50. Precooked chicken strips with micro waved frozen broccoli topped with Parmesan cheese is also a quick and easy meal.</li>
					<li>51. There are a lot of healthy frozen entrees available these days that make mealtime quick and easy. Choose one low in calories and enjoy with a salad and a glass of 1 percent milk.</li>
					<li>52. I still love scrambled eggs in a nonstick pan. Pop some asparagus in the microwave and add whole-wheat toast and presto your eating in no time. If your cholesterol levels are normal, you can have seven eggs a week with the yolk, so if you mix egg whites with a whole egg that’s cool too.</li>
					<li>53. A bag of frozen vegetables heated in the microwave, topped with 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons of chopped nuts.</li>
					<li>54. Pre-bagged salad topped with canned tuna, grape tomatoes, shredded reduced-fat cheese, and low-cal Italian dressing.</li>
					<li>55. Keep lean sandwich fixings on hand like whole wheat bread, sliced turkey, reduced-fat cheese, tomatoes, mustard and horseradish.</li>
					<li>56. Heat up a can of good soup. Or better yet, make your own soup and freeze serving sizes to have later.</li>
					<li>57. Cereal, fruit, and fat-free milk makes a good meal anytime.</li>
					<li>58. Try a veggie sandwich. </li>
					<li>59. Precut fruit for a salad and add yogurt.</li>
					<li>60. Don't tell yourself, "It's okay, it's the holidays." That opens the door to 6 weeks of splurging and added pounds with every party, cookie and drink.</li>

					<h4>Special Tips:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><span>1. Less is more:</span> Frequency is almost always more beneficial than duration when working out. For example, although theoretically you are burning the same amount of calories, five 30-minute workouts are going to be more beneficial to your health than two 75-minute sessions.</li>
						<li><span>2. Cut down on alcohol:</span> If you're trying to lose weight, remember to count the booze - a single gin and tonic has about 140 calories.</li>
						<li><span>3. Write down your diet goals:</span> If you don't know why you want something, it won't be as important for you to get it. But be positive. Don't write down things like "I don't want to be this big or this fat". This is telling yourself what you don't want. Instead write down positive goals like, "I want to look great in my little black number on Valentine's Day". This is telling yourself exactly what you want.</li>
						<li><span>4. Go tropical:</span> Tropical fruits, especially pineapples and paw paw are very good foods to protect you against cellulite. They're extremely rich sources of beta carotene, which is very important for healthy skin and contain natural enzymes that are extremely good for the digestions and help break down fat deposits.</li>
						<li><span>5. Take the half hour challenge:</span> Exercise burns calories. A daily 30-minute brisk walk will burn around 1,500 calories every week. Over six months this totals a staggering 39,000 calories - the equivalent to over 11lb of fat.</li>
						<li><span>6. It's in the can:</span> Canned rice pudding is great for lifting calcium levels, pilchards offer Omega-3 fatty acids and vegetables are full of vitamins. Adding beans, peas and lentils into a dish will make it go further and increase the protein and iron values of the meal.</li>
						<li><span>7. Don't go exercise crazy:</span> Being a fitness junkie is probably more dangerous than not doing anything at all. It's the 80/20 thing - if you're good for 80 per cent of the time, you can be bad for the other 20 per cent.</li>

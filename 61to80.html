					<li>61. Remember, EAT before you meet. Have a small meal before you go to any party like a hardboiled Egg, Apple, and a thirst quencher (water, seltzer, diet soda, tea) which will help you cut down on your alcohol consumption.</li>
					<li>62. As obvious as it sounds, don't stand near the food at parties. By doing this you'll find you eat less.</li>
					<li>63. At a buffet? Eating a little of everything guarantees you will eat more calories than you need. A good strategy would be to decide on three or four choices, only one of which is high in calories. Eat your high calorie choice last and you’ll find that you eat less.</li>
					<li>64. For the duration of the holidays, wear your snuggest clothes that don't allow much room for expansion. Wearing sweats is out until January.</li>
					<li>65. After your company leaves, give away your leftover food to neighbors, doormen, delivery people, or take it to work the next day.</li>
					<li>66. Walk around the mall three times before you start shopping.</li>
					<li>67. Make exercise a nonnegotiable priority. You may lose weight while on some diets but long-term weight loss is accomplished and maintained by a balance of diet and exercise.</li>
					<li>68. Dance to music with your family in your home and be active with your kids. It’s one of the easiest ways to involve the whole family in exercise.</li>
					<li>69. If you have a sweet tooth and you just have to indulge, that’s all right. Have a lean salad for lunch or dinner, and save your main calories for a full dessert. Just don’t do this every day.</li>
					<li>70. After going a few days without sweets, you will be able to avoid binging.</li>
					<li>71. If you think you need a very sweet treat every night, try to strike a balance between healthy choices. Compromise with low-fat ice cream and fruit, or sometimes just fruit with a topping of whipped cream.</li>
					<li>72. Try 2 weeks without sweets. It's amazing how your cravings vanish.</li>
					<li>73. Eat more fruit. If you get enough fruit in your diet chances are your won’t have a raging sweet tooth.</li>
					<li>74. Eat your sweets, but limit them to about 150 calories per day for your favorite sweet. That amounts to about an ounce of chocolate, half a modest slice of cake, or 1/2 cup of regular ice cream.</li>
					<li>75. Try these smart little sweets: sugar-free hot cocoa, frozen red grapes, fudgsicles, sugar-free gum, Nutri-Grain chocolate fudge twists, Tootsie Rolls, and hard candy.</li>
					<li>76. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you miss one of these meals, there is a high chance that you will struggle with nighttime eating and binging. </li>
					<li>77. Eat your evening meal in the kitchen or dining room sitting down at your table.</li>
					<li>78. Drink cold unsweetened raspberry tea. It tastes great and keeps your mouth busy and you won’t binge eat while watching your favorite show.</li>
					<li>79. Change your nighttime schedule. It will take effort, but it will pay off. You need something that will occupy your mind and hands. Maybe find a hobby.</li>
					<li>80. If you're eating at night due to emotions, you need to focus on getting in touch with what's going on and taking care of yourself in a way that really works. Find a nonfood method of coping with your stress like exercise and you don’t have to go to a gym, you can simply go for a walk.</li>

					<h4>Special Tips:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><span>1. Avoid man-sized meals:</span> When cooking for two, don't just split meals into two equal portions. You don't need to eat as much as your partner.</li>
						<li><span>2. The great outdoors:</span> Central heating, open fires, poor ventilation and stress all cause havoc with our bodies. They can cause us to be listless, droopy-eyed and tired - not to mention what they do to our appearance. So combat this by getting out and about as much as possible. Try to fit in a walk, even just ten minutes, every day. It will be ten minutes well spent and will make you feel great and help you sleep better too.</li>
						<li><span>3. Be clever on holiday:</span> Don't crash diet before you go away on holiday, you'll be so hungry when you get to your destination you'll eat everything and anything. It's better to eat sensibly before and during your stay.</li>
						<li><span>4. Go nuts:</span> Pistachios are a good source of potassium and they provide a whole collection of heart friendly nutrients such as vitamin B6, magnesium and copper and are a useful source of antioxidants, including selenium and vitamin E. They are also cholesterol free and snacking on them regularly, within a healthy, balanced diet, may actually help to reduce blood cholesterol levels.</li>
						<li><span>5. Don't yo-yo diet:</span> Repeated weight loss and gain changes the structure and number of your fat cells, which ultimately make it much easier for you to regain weight you've worked hard to lose. Once created, fat cells never disappear, they can only shrink.</li>
						<li><span>6. Eat negative calories:</span> A portion of brussel sprouts is worth 50 calories; yet 75 calories are used in digestion and absorption, so burning 25 calories of body fat. Other negative calories foods include broccoli, carrots, celery, leeks, apples, kiwis, satsumas and strawberries.</li>
						<li><span>7. Up your fibre intake:</span> It is estimated that a third of cancers could be prevented by changes in diet. A diet which is high in fibre, and wholegrain cereal, and low in fat has the potential to prevent a number of cancers, including colon, stomach and breast cancers.</li>

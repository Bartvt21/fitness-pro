				<ul>
					<li>1. Add just one fruit or vegetable serving daily. When you get comfortable with that, continue to add an extra serving per day until you reach 8 to 10 servings per day.</li>
					<li>2. Eat at least two servings of a fruit or veggie at every meal.</li>
					<li>3. Never super size your food portions</li>
					<li>4. Whenever you put food in your mouth, peel it, unwrap it, put it on a plate and sit down and enjoy. Enjoy all of your senses in the pleasure of nourishing your body.</li>
					<li>5. Start your day off by eating a big breakfast. It helps you eat fewer total calories throughout the day.</li>
					<li>6. Make sure your plate is half veggies and/or fruit at both lunch and dinner.</li>
					<li>7. When dining out, eat only half and take the remainder home. A typical restaurant entree has 1,000 to 2,000 calories and that’s not even counting the bread, appetizers, beverages and dessert.</li>
					<li>8. When dining out and you want desert, order only one and share it.</li>
					<li>9. Use a salad plate instead of a dinner plate, a desert bowl instead of soup bowl and a juice glass instead of water tumbler.</li>
					<li>10. See what you eat. Put your food on a plate or in a bowl instead of eating out of the jar or bag.</li>
					<li>11. Eat the low-cal items on your plate first. Start with salads, veggies, and broth soups, and eat meats and starches last. By the time you get to them, you'll be full enough to be content with smaller portions of the high-calorie choices.</li>
					<li>12. Instead of whole milk, switch to 1 percent. If you drink one 8-oz glass a day, you'll lose 5 lb in a year.</li>
					<li>13. Juice has as many calories, ounce for ounce, as soda. Set a limit of one 8-oz glass of fruit juice a day.</li>
					<li>14. Get calories from foods you chew, not beverages. Have fresh fruit instead of fruit juice.</li>
					<li>15. Keep a food journal. It really works.</li>
					<li>16. Eat until you are eight-tenths full.</li>
					<li>17. Use mustard instead of mayo.</li>
					<li>18. Eat more soup. But choose non-creamy soups, which are filling and lower in calories.</li>
					<li>19. Cut back on or eliminate high calorie drinks such as soda, sweet tea, lemonade, etc. If you drink a 20-oz of soft drink every day, switch to the diet version or eliminate them completely and from just this one change you could lose up to 25 lb in a year.</li>
					<li>20. Take your lunch to work.</li>

					<h4>Special Tips:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><span>1. Diet for the season: </span> Get up earlier in summer and later in winter, in line with natural sunlight hours. Don't eat late at night or before you're fully awake.</li>
						<li><span>2. Stay hydrated at the gym:</span> Your gym may have drinking fountains but they won't help you keep an eye on how much you drink. Make sure you take a large bottle with you to the gym and keep it to hand whenever you are in class or on a machine.</li>
						<li><span>3. Shake things up:</span> Though there's not much scientific proof that it works, some dieters find that changing some of their meal plan selections from week to week seems to help them break through a plateau. Simple changes like switching some of those chicken portions for fish or having a chicken salad instead of an egg salad at lunch could make a difference for you. Not to mention ensuring your taste buds stay interested.</li>
						<li><span>4. Too much chocolate:</span> Every time you eat a chocolate biscuit instead of an apple you are choosing to be fat. One biscuit won't make you fat but it will certainly influence what you eat later and it reinforces for you, the choice is always the chocolate rather than the apple.</li>
						<li><span>5. Work your stretch:</span> Some stretches may feel uncomfortable initially but try to stay in them, even if only for a short while. As long as you feel no pain, you should not be in danger of injuring yourself. Don't bounce your stretch. Breathe calmly and regularly through your nose.</li>
						<li><span>6. Accept who you are:</span> The key to getting over your idea of a perfect body is to accept what you have. If you hate your body, it won't work with you. If you accept your body - and even learn to like it - you can achieve peace with your food.</li>
						<li><span>7. Fat-free? Not necessarily:</span> Put the words "low-fat" or "fat-free" on the label and people will assume it won't make them fat. But it's worth knowing that "fat-free" or "low-fat" or "no added fat" usually means more sugar. Simple white refined sugar is the very stuff which converts to fat once in the body.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>81. Put a sign on the kitchen and refrigerator doors: Closed after Dinner.</li>
					<li>82. Brush your teeth right after dinner to remind yourself that you are finished eating for the night. (And brush before you go to bed and needless to say, after every meal)</li>
					<li>83. Eat without engaging in any other simultaneous activity. No reading, watching TV, or sitting at your computer. You can easily lose track of how much you are eating and how long it takes you.</li>
					<li>84. Eating late at night won't cause weight gain. It's how many calories, not when you eat them that counts.</li>
					<li>85. Fat-free isn't always your best bet and doesn’t mean low in calories. Research has found that none of the lycopene or alpha- or beta-carotene that fight cancer and heart disease is absorbed from salads with fat-free dressing. Only slightly more is absorbed with reduced-fat dressing. The most is absorbed with full-fat dressing. But remember to use your dressing in moderate amounts and have it on the side.</li>
					<li>86. Skipping breakfast will leave you tired and by midmorning you will be craving and making bad food choices. To fill up try this sweet, fruity breakfast. In a blender, process 1-cup nonfat plain or vanilla yogurt, 1 1/3 cup frozen strawberries (no added sugar), 1 peeled kiwi, and 1 peeled banana. Pulse until mixture is milkshake consistency. Makes one 2-cup serving; 348 calories and 1.5 fat grams.</li>
					<li>87. If you're famished by 4 p.m. and have no alternative but an office vending machine, reach for the nuts or drink water. Sometimes when you feel hungry what you are actually feeling is dehydrated.</li>
					<li>88. Next time you're feeling wiped out in late afternoon, forget the cup of coffee and reach for a cup of yogurt instead. The combination of protein, carbohydrate, and fat in an 8-ounce serving of low-fat yogurt will give you a sense of fullness and well-being that coffee can't match, as well as some vital nutrients. If you haven't eaten in 3 to 4 hours, your blood glucose levels are probably dropping, so eating a small amount of nutrient-rich food will give your brain and your body a boost.</li>
					<li>89. Making just a few changes to your kitchen shelves can get you a lot closer to your weight loss goals. Here's what to do. If you use corn and peanut oil, replace it with olive oil. Same goes for breads change to whole wheat. Trade in those fatty cold cuts like salami and bologna and replace them with canned tuna, sliced turkey breast, and lean roast beef. Change from drinking whole milk to fat-free milk or low-fat soy milk. This is hard for a lot of people so try transitioning down to 2 percent and then 1 percent before you go fat-free.</li>
					<li>90. Nothing's less appetizing than a refrigerator full of mushy vegetables. Frozen vegetables store much better, plus they may have greater nutritional value than fresh. Food suppliers typically freeze vegetables just a few hours after harvest, locking in their nutrients. Fresh vegetables, on the other hand, often spend days in the back of a truck before they reach your supermarket.</li>
					<li>91. There has been a lot of press about the trans-fat content in your peanut butter. In a test done on Skippy, JIF, Peter Pan, and a supermarket brand, the levels of trans fats per 2-tablespoon serving were far lower than 0.5 gram. This is low enough that under proposed laws, the brands can legally claim zero trans fats on the label. They also contained only 1 gram more sugar than natural brands, not a significant difference.</li>
					<li>92. Overeating is not the result of exercise. Vigorous exercise won't stimulate you to overeat. It's just the opposite. Exercise at any level helps curb your appetite immediately following your workout.</li>
					<li>93. When you're exercising, you shouldn't wait to feel thirsty before you take a drink. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated. To avoid this you should drink at least 16 ounces of water, sports drink, or juice two hours before you exercise. Then drink 8 ounces an hour before and another 4 to 8 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes during your workout. Finish with at least 16 ounces after you're done exercising.</li>
					<li>94. Listen to an audio book while you walk. It'll keep you going longer and looking forward to your next walk and the next chapter! Check your local library for a great selection. Look for a whodunit. You might walk so far you'll need to take a cab home!</li>
					<li>95. Think yoga's too serene to burn calories? Think again. You can burn 250 to 350 calories during an hour-long class (that's as much as you'd burn from an hour of walking)! Plus, you'll improve muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance.</li>
					<li>96. Drinking too few can hamper your weight loss efforts. That's because dehydration can slow your metabolism by 3 percent, or about 45 fewer calories burned a day, which in a year could mean weighing 5 pounds more. The key to water isn't how much you drink, it's how frequently you drink it. Small amounts sipped often work better than 8 ounces gulped down at once.</li>
					<li>97. If you find it difficult to do it yourself, find A registered dietitian who maybe able to help you find healthy ways to manage your weight with food.</li>
					<li>98. The best place to drop pounds may be a social group or club. Weight loss programs based on group support are so successful because there's a built-in community component that people can feel comfortable with.</li>
					<li>99. Here's a reason to keep calm all the times. If you have high blood pressure and heart rate caused by stress you are at a risk of eating twice as many fatty snacks as your calmer counterparts.</li>
					<li>100. Sitting at your computer may help you slim down. Searching and receiving weekly e-mail tips and advise helps to lose weight as you are more likely to implement some of the tips and tricks. </li>

					<h4>Special Tips:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><span>1. Banish the D-word</span> Don't say, "I can't eat that because I'm on a diet". Say "I choose not to eat that because I know it's bad for me.</li>
						<li><span>2. The two-day rule</span> If you're trying to lose weight, don't let more than 48 hours go by without doing some form of exercise as it's important to keep your metabolic rate raised if you want to burn fat. Post exercise, your body burns calories at an elevated rate for at least four to five hours.</li>
						<li><span>3. The bin is not a sin</span> It's your waist that is a waste. Try not to cook more food than you need or more than you can eat. However, if you do have leftover food, try to freeze it or store it safely to have another time.</li>
						<li><span>4. Cut back on salt</span> Don't add salt when you cook. If you can't avoid eating it, drink lots of water both during and after the meal. And the next day eat plenty of foods that have high water content such as fruit and vegetables to flush out your system.</li>
						<li><span>5. Do the right reps for you</span> For muscle endurance training do up to 18 or 20 repetitions at a weight that starts to fatigue you at 14 or 15. To build strength or develop muscle size, up to 10-12 repetitions at a weight that starts to fatigue you at seven or eight. Hold stretches for between 30-90 seconds.</li>
						<li><span>6. Don't pig out</span> Eat when you are hungry, not out of habit. Graze rather than gorge. Eat little and often, with plenty of fruit as snacks in-between.</li>
